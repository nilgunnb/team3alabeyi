                                    <p>Baku European Liseym was the location of our Hour of Code. We are grateful to Said for reaching out to Tarana Hanum, who was both his homeroom teacher throughout his school years and the one who set everything up and allowed us to have our Hour of Code. Furthermore, without Ilhama Hanum, the teacher whose class we were conducting an Hour of Code for, we would have been powerless. She assisted us in keeping the classroom disciplined and in organizing technical moments.</p>

                                    <p>We had to play video on a projector and listen to audio from Said's notebook because Azim's notebook's sound wasn't working, so it was best to leave it alone. Additionally, we had to develop two strategies: one for when there would be computers in the classroom and another for when there wouldn't be. This was because we were unsure about the classroom's setup and whether or not computers would be available for kids.  If so, we would use all computers to launch a game about artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning.  Should it not be feasible, we shall use our laptop to play for the entire class and project it onto the screen.</p>

                                    <p>We screened an interesting film including computer science titans, such Mark Zuckerberg, Drew Houston, Gabe Newell, and others, sharing their own computer and programming narratives.  We then moved on to the game portion. While not everyone finished it, most of the course had been completed; with a little more time, everyone could have finished. We concluded with a brief lecture that lasted about 20 minutes. Every student had an original thought, which they were not afraid to share with us. While some were primarily interested in having fun, others were quite interested in the subject and may have even become inspired.</p>

                                    <p>All things considered, our Hour of Code was a success; the children learned new things, and we also gained expertise and a better grasp of our industry. Additionally, collaborating with others is a beneficial and successful experience that will benefit us in the future.</p>
